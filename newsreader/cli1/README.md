# CLI for News API

This folder has code for creating and running a CLI to call the NEWS APIs hosted in Verse

## Calling the methods

Once this code is ready, we can call the APIs using following approach

```sh
python newscli.py hello
```

for now the *newsapi.definitions.json* is implicit; so it is not provided everytime

## TODO: More operations to be covered shortly
