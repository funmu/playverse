# Playverse

Verse is a new framework for building services. With its component and provider model, one can quickly build and host services across a wide range of backends. In this repository we will have a variety of projects to *play with verse*

## Newsreader

A simple service that wraps the newsapi.org services. This service also illustrates how easy it is to build with Verse. See [newsreader](./newsreader/) for details. 

- See [News API](./newsreader/newsapi/) for the API implemented and hosted using *verse* framework
- See [News Web1](./newsreader/web1) for a simple web client built using python/flask
